## Abstract

This proof of concept validates the feasibility of a self-sustaining, modular outdoor cooling device capable of reducing ambient temperature by 3°F (1.7°C) within a 9-foot radius and up to two stories vertically. The system, OpenCryoCore, employs solid-state thermoelectric modules, piston-based kinetic energy generation, solar-charged battery storage, and radial fan-based dispersion to produce localized atmospheric cooling without refrigerants or compressors.

This approach is particularly suited for extreme heat mitigation in arid cities (e.g. Lake Havasu City, AZ or Riyadh, Saudi Arabia) and is scalable to district-level deployment using distributed pole-mounted clusters.

## Design Principles

- Use the Peltier effect for rapid solid-state cooling (no moving parts in core engine)
- Encapsulate in a vacuum-insulated metallic shell (e.g., modified Contigo container geometry)
- Harvest mechanical energy from vibration and impact via a piston-like shake generator
- Disperse cold air radially with high-efficiency 360° fan
- Model energy and thermal flow with physics-consistent feedback loops
- Employ swarm-style cluster logic (“HyperPoles”) for urban-scale deployment

## Simulation Results

- Simulated 9-foot sphere (6.6 m³ volume) cooled from 103°F → 100°F over 12 minutes using 280W net input
- Temperature remained stable within radius using 360W continuous cooling + fan power
- Total power draw (worst case): ~18Wh per hour
- Solar panel + piston recharge replenishes ~40–60Wh/day

## Environmental Constraints

- Passive air convection minimized via structural shielding (e.g., housing and ground-mount shade)
- External ambient heat gain modeled and balanced via environment_sim module
- Self-recovery logic allows device to auto-throttle and prioritize critical uptime windows

## Scalable Deployment Model

- Single device covers: ~9 ft radius x 18 ft tall
- Cluster of 9 devices (1 HyperPole): covers ~18 ft radius zone
- Grid of 1,000 HyperPoles in urban pattern reduces city-wide temp footprint
- Cumulative microclimate effect includes radiative absorption reduction and potential atmospheric lift (early stage)

## Key Innovations

- Zero-refrigerant system using fully solid-state cooling tech
- Combined energy strategy: ambient solar + piston kinetic
- Locally manufacturable components — no exotic materials
- Real-time feedback via web dashboard for remote monitoring

## Future Enhancements

- Cloud-connected swarm logic for real-time thermal mapping
- Addition of radiative shielding coatings for desert deployment
- Integration with public infrastructure (e.g., light poles, traffic signs)
- Lithium-Titanate or Graphene battery enhancements for high-cycle recharge

## Validation Plan

- Phase 1: Prototype in controlled chamber (9 ft radius testbed)
- Phase 2: Outdoor test in Havasu under summer conditions
- Phase 3: Full HyperPole cluster install and effect mapping via IR drone
